# Reference Datatype

Solidity provides the following reference types:
1) Arrays: These are fixed as well as dynamic arrays. Details are given later in this chapter.
2) Structs: These are custom, user-defined structures.
3) String: This is sequence of characters. In Solidity, strings are eventually stored as bytes. Details are give later in this chapter.
4) Mappings: This is similar to a hash table or dictionary in other languages storing key-value pairs.
