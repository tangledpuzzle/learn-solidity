# Value Data types

Value types are types that do not take more than 32 bytes of memory in size. Solidity provides the following value types:
1) bool: The boolean value that can hold true or false as its value
2) uint: These are unsigned integers that can hold 0 and positive values only
3) int: These are signed integers that can hold both negative and positive values
4) address: This represents an address of an account on Ethereum environment
5) byte: This represents fixed sized byte array (byte1 to bytes32)
6) enum: Enumerations that can hold predefined constant values
